Pratap 
	Added basic sound blaster detection, mixer, and (non-functional) 
	playing capabilities. Minor hacks to get vesa working in reorganised
	src, added TODO.

A.R.Karthick for MIR

	Initiator and Author: Pratap


Karthick-Done some massive reorganisation and some rewrites of the whole tree.
Karthick-Rewrote the Makefile to make it more structured.
Karthick-Implemented process management and memory Management.
 (scheduler,timer,wait_queue,slab_cache,bitmap allocator).
Karthick-Enabled PAGING with a direct mapping.
Karthick-Implemented vmalloc or virtual contiguous and physical non-contiguous           allocation.	  
Karthick-Implemented CPU exception handling
  (20 exceptions are handled.The process causing the exception is killed.Check out the code for the rest.The exception handling interface is a bit generic though.)
Karthick- Implemented an additional pgtable cache for fast pgtable mappings to setup the PTE entries.(for use with vmalloc primarily:)
Karthick- Wrote reboot routine and halt routine now comes out of BOCHS by causing a triple fault.
Karthick- Fixed some minor things with the keyboard driver.

9/11/2003:
Karthick - Implemented Semaphores for MIR Kernel which is a part of IPC.
Karthick - Brought in asm/time.h for read time stamp counter.Some more work needs to be done in this aspect.

8/12/2003 -
Karthick-  Changed the bitoperations and brought in a new implementation which is sophisticated and uses assembly to speed up bit operations.
	  include/asm/bitops.h
	
28/12/2003-
Karthick
	 Brought in a change in the way gdt,idts are handled.
	 Recoded multi.asm as multi.S
	 Brought in descriptor definitions and introduced clarity in the code.
	 Recoded the processor identification routines.
	 Quite a few changes which also includes a new file processor.c,
	 asm/segment.h
01/01/2004-
Karthick
	Brought in changes to make MIR boot from a floppy.
	Plus some trivial changes to CPU detection + multi.S debugging 
	enhancement to make debugging comfortable during crashes with MIR 
	bootstraps from floppy.

06/01/2004-
Karthick
	Brought in major changes with keyboard driver rewrites,
	virtual console preliminary setup, plus various other hacks
	related to keyboard driver rewrites.

11/01/2004-
Karthick
	Brought in full fledged virtual console support.
	Fixed some major bugs related to spurious crashes.
	Made changes to accomodate for ret_eip and argument maintenance
	for tasks.
	Wrote a stress testing module to create and kill 30 tasks.
	Made random hacks and additions to the source.

08/02/2004-
Karthick
	Rewrote the IRQ interface to make it generic and controller independent. Changed other parts of the code accordingly.

15/02/2004 -
Karthick
	Introduced Tasklets and changed the corresponding code to use tasklets.

22/02/2004 -
Karthick
	Worked on some hangs related in MIR

24/02/2004-
Karthick
        Got a reboot hang report and worked on some spawn_test_task hangs with the stress test module. Fixed the hangs by introducing a call to __schedule
which is to be used as of now when using the scheduler from Kernel space.
Also corrected some CLI,STI calls with respect to save_flags and restore_flags.
Made sure that the scheduler is now called with interrupts disabled,to pick up the next task. Fixed some races related to these issues also.
Made a stable release for MIR	

29/02/2004-
Karthick
	Did some hacks to the MIR code in general.Introduced a bottom half
	in the keyboard driver.Corrected a memory leak in slab allocator,
	+ other random hacks

01/03/2004-
Karthick	
	Did some hacks to the MIR code in general.Corrected some IRQ calls.
	Did some random changes to the MIR tree in general,towards a stable release. Removed some old unused stale files from the MIR cvs of ark-mir004 branch.

08/03/2004-
Karthick
	 Random hacks and fixes to the MIR code.
	 Changed the asm/string.h and asm/bitops.h functions to take the early clobber operand into account. Rewrote the memset,memcpy routines to optimise them by using a combination movsl and movsb to save CPU cycles.

27/03/2004-
Karthick
	Tested the changes to bitops.h and string.h. Some spurious crashes happen, but difficult to trace. Anyway, its pretty much stable with changes to bitops.h and string.h
	IDE driver started. Modified the IDE driver of TABOS, and made it work with MIR. Implemented the BUFFER cache for MIR.

28/03/2004-
Karthick	
	Some minor IDE driver changes to integrate with the current release for Pratap to check out.
	This should get into 005.
	
03/04/2004-
Karthick
	IDE driver changes to make ide writes go through.Changes to make it work with BOCHS by bootstrapping through the hard disk image.Tested read/writes w.r.t to IDE driver.

11/04/2004-
Karthick
	IDE ATAPI CDROM driver changes.
	Tested the driver changes.Some more additions to the shell commands.
	Changed the buffer cache to call device/major number specific block_transfer_function registered by each device.

25/04/2004-
Karthick	
	 Some Kernel ELF changes to show ksyms.Some routines added in utils.

05/05/2004-
Karthick
	Revamped Module loader for MIR with rmmod support,and one can export symbols.

30/05/2004-
Karthick	
	Merged Prataps VFS changes to my tree.
	Introduced string routines in assembly
	Made some random hacks.
	Ready for making changes for a stable VFS.

06/06/2004-
	VFS changes for VFS cache lookup. Total reimplementation

	Speeded up the lookup procedure through a VFS cache.
	Many other random hacks.

12-13/06/2004-
 	Massive changes ,additions to the MIR tree.
	Implemented VFS changes for generic block devices to go through the buffer cache.
	Made the FDC also to go through the cache.
	Implemented generic transfer routines for block devices.
	Added these new files:
	
	a) include/mir/floppy.h 
	b) include/mir/fs/fat.h
	c) mir/fs/fat/fat_commands.c
	d) mir/fs/vfs.c  (old: kernel/vfs directory)
	d)mir/drivers/block/blockops.c

	Massive changes/additions to the following files and renamed them as "vfs.*"
	
	a) include/mir/vfs/vfs.h (old -> vnode.h )
	b)mir/fs/vfs.c - (old kernel/vfs/vnode.c)
	c) Removed the kernel/vfs directory
	d) Removed the file mir/fs/fat.c 

	Massive changes to VFS,block device layer,generic devices related to VFS.
	Changes to the FDC driver, IDE block drivers to make use of the generic DEVICE interface in VFS.
	Released version 0.05 for MIR

       Some changes to the cdrom driver and other random hacks.
       Created a mir_005 CVS branch.

03/07/2004 -Karthick
	Implemented File Management routines.
	Introduced per process file management structure.
	Moved cwd to per process.
	Cleaned up a subtle memset bug, and made it faster.
	Increased the THREAD_SIZE to 16K now ,so as to a have
	a larger stack size for processes,to prevent stack underruns,
	resulting in general protection exception.
	Other random hacks to the MIR subsystem in General.
