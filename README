MIR-OS 
  

Entire OS written from scratch
except 
	1) vsprintf - from linux 0.0.1, thanks to linus
	2) 50% of the fdc code - thanks to fabian

NOTES on vesa usage on bochs (this wont work until we get v86 support)
	1) you have to change the default VGA rom (in bochsrc.txt) from 
	/usr/local/share/bochs/VGABIOS-elpin-2.40
	to
	/usr/local/share/bochs/VGABIOS-lgpl-latest.

	bochs supports only 1024x768x256, 8bpp

NOTES on floppy image
there is an floppy image in the root dir of mir-os which has grub pre-installed.
so to install mir-os kernel + modules onto it do the following

#mkdir /mir_img
#losetup /dev/loop0 grubimg

and 
#make

this will 'make' mir-os and install the required kernel and modules into the floppy image file which is mounted on a pseudo block device.
